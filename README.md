# Machine Learning with TensorFlow - FreeCodeCamp

Student's notebook with projects for the Machine Learning with TensorFlow certification of FreeCodeCamp

Each project of this course has its own purpose, this allows me to walk through different approaches of machine learning. From a first approach with a predictive rock/paper/scissor algorithm to a neural network that classifies text.

###Rock Paper Scissors: 
A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.
###Cat and Dog Image Classifier: 
Code to classify images of dogs and cats. I used TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. 
###Book Recommendation Engine using KNN: 
Create a book recommendation algorithm using K-Nearest Neighbors. I used the [Book-Crossings](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) dataset. This dataset contains 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
###Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator: 
Predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. I was given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. Used the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.
###Neural Network SMS Text Classifier: 
Create a machine learning model that classifies SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
